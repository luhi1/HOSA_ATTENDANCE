# HOSA_ATTENDANCE
This is a highly specialized tool for basically just parsing a single (very poorly organized) .csv file to get first name and last name.
This project was intended to be an entire attendance tool for the HOSA club at my school, however it ended up being uneccesary and the project retired.
For any requests for this project or ideas to revive this, create an issue on this github page!
